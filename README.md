ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Carlos, MSc. in Infectious Diseases and a PhD student in the same field working with transcriptomics.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything related to Science in general and Data Science.

ğŸŒ± Currently, I work mostly in R but I am currently learning some more Python and ocasionally JavaScript too.
