### Hi, I’m Carlos!😄

## 📝 About me


MSc. in Infectious Diseases and a PhD student in the same field, I am currently a researcher working with transcriptomics at the Center For Infectious Diseases (<i>Núcleo de Doenças Infecciosas</i>, in portuguese) at Federal University of Espírito Santo (Espírito Santo - Brazil). I am part of a research team focused in uncovering the mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of [cutaneous leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis), which has been demonstrated to be driven by a feature of the immune system called [immunosenescence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2265901/#:~:text=Immunosenescence%2C%20defined%20as%20the%20changes,to%20increase%20healthy%20life%20expectancy).
